## 🧐 About Me  
Currently studying to become a Software Quality Engineer, diving into Programming Logic and discovering new technologies that I’m falling in love with. When I’m not learning, I’m either training at the gym, perfecting my footvolley game, or practicing Jiu Jitsu. I love learning new things, traveling, and enjoying a good wine.
